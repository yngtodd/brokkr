BROKKR
======

A case study for Pytorch and Nvidia.

Brokkr, pronounced “BRAW-ker”, was a metal worker of Norse legend. Together with his brother, Eitiri, he
forged the hammer hammer Mjölnir (Thor's hammer). While Eitiri worked with magic inside the brothers' forge,
Brokkr worked the bellows so that the forge's fire would not cool down nor become too hot for the magic.
Like its eponymous smith, this library tends to our metal, making sure our GPUs are neither too cold
nor too hot.
